            </li>
            <li><b>Sandwich Fixings</b>
            <ul><li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>½ cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>12 ounces fresh spinach</li>
            <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Manchego cheese</li>
            <li>4 crusty rolls</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p><b>Steps</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Make the pork: Remove the netting or strings from pork roast, keeping them intact to use again. Combine rosemary, parsley, garlic, 3 teaspoons oil, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, and 1 tablespoon pepper in a bowl. Slice open pork roast and spread it with herb mixture. Roll up pork and secure it with the netting or string. Rub remaining 1 teaspoon oil all over pork; season with more salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place pork, fat-side up, in a roasting pan; pour in water. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting occasionally and adding more water if necessary, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the meat reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Reserve pan juices in the roasting pan.</li>
            <li>While the pork is resting, prepare fixings: Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Stir in garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant but not brown, about 3 minutes. Pour in chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add spinach, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until spinach is wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
            <li>Cut and remove the string from the roast. Cut pork into thin slices. Return sliced pork to the juices in the roasting pan. </li>
            <li>Slice sandwich rolls. Sprinkle Manchego cheese over split rolls, add pork slices, and top with spinach. </li>
